<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>Simple, clean fried rice. </p>
<p>The recipe works best when practiced and optimized in small increments.
<p>These are the measurements and exact brands for my own optimized recipe, for one specific pot.</p>
<p>Yours <em>will</em> differ!</p>
<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>750 ml of water.</li>
    <li>400 ml white rice. red Riceland works best, but jasmin rice works too</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Wash the rice, or don't. Dry completely</li>
    <li>Add oil to pot, then add the rice</li>
    <li>Put some water to heat up. Make it a little hot but nowhere near boiling. 
    <li>Wait until rice begins lightly sizzling</li>
    <li>Begin stirring the rice. On the highest heat stir briskly and continously as it can burn down fast.</li>
    <li>The grains will should first turn matte white, then a light straw color. A few brown spots are OK. Black however is yuck.</li>
    <li>Add the salt, add the water. Ideally the water is just warm enough to end up below boiling, without mess.</li>
    <li>Cover pot, set timer to 18 minutes</li>
    <li>Do not stir, do not check</li>
    <li>Return seconds before alarm sounds.</li>
    <l1>Take rice off fire. Stir it up to a fluffy consistency.</l1>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
